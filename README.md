# Pillars-Prep

## What the heck is 'Pillars'?
This is a day-long assessment of what you've learned so far. Your instructional team wants to look at areas where students are struggling and work to improve knowledge and confidence in these topics prior to JPFP (Junior Phase Final Project).

## How does grading work?
Grading helps us see who is doing well on each topic and who might need more help. Answer code should be submitted by 6pm ET on Friday, Nov. 25th.

### Requirements
The feature requirements detailed in the project are your primary source of truth for it. The provided test specs are there to supplement your development process. However, your score will be based on the number of requirements implemented. Code that does not pass the related test specs, but still accomplishes the required feature will receive credit.

### Evaluation
Your final evaluation will be weighted as follows:
- Requirements score (75%)
- [Rubric score](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JctZDSVLImKT-sJ7BwhVPrHgZ17pRSuE0FhbLKLxsBs/edit#gid=0) (25%)
- Extra credit (10% max)

## More about the project!
### Overview
You are the lead engineer for Acme Tutors, an educational services company. Your job is to complete a tutoring dashboard for students and their mentors. Your team has already built a fully-functional front-end, as well as test specs for all the required server-side business features. Your fullstack expertise is required to complete the app. Before getting started, please carefully review the expectations. The project is organized into five tiers of increasing difficulty - we recommend you work on them in order, finishing Tier 1 before starting Tier 2, and so on. If you get stuck, you are free to move on to later tiers, but keep in mind that some later features may depend on earlier features.
